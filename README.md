# OpenBarre_analysis
Through the QUEST Honors program at the University of Maryland, I had the privilege of leading a multidisciplinary team in providing insights regarding the optimal ways to post on social media for the purposes of growth and higher interactions for OpenBarre, a local Barre gym located in College Park, Maryland. We were given spreadsheets of raw data relating to its Facebook and Instagram posts, and went through the process of feature engineering (including log transformations and one hot encoding), creating regression models, and presenting clear data visualizations. As the coder on my team, I'm pleased to present the Python scripts I was able to develop, which backed our claims.
